## Bio

I'm Brandon Lee, aka *Solverism*, a Senior Data Scientist currently employed at GlobalLogic. I've worked across multiple industries as a consultant including agriculture, construction, utiliites, and automotive where I've solved a variety of challenging and interesting data science problems.

I'm a huge believer of being a life time learner where the learning doesn't stop once you've reached a certain career goal. No, I believe learning should be thought of as a tool that will allow you to become the best version of yourself. A tool that allows you to be constantly honed and sharpened, ready to face any challenges that face your way - be it personal or professional.

When I'm not trying to preach my life philsophy to strangers online, I'm usually building, tinkering with, or thinking of new ideas for data science projects in my free time. These usually start with a small idea but can somehow grow to multiple fully-fledged projects. More often than not, they come about because I want to put some new skills or concepted I've learned on client projects into practice. Outside of data science, I'm also pretty passionate about physical fitness.

Hopefully you'll learn a thing or two from visiting my blog, enjoy your stay and feel free to send me a message!
